## Overwiew:
MonkeyPoll is a web application for creating, sharing, and analyzing surveys with ease.  

Users can design surveys featuring various question types, including open-ended text responses, numerical inputs, and multiple-choice options. After creating a survey, users can share it for others to complete. Once the survey is closed, creators can review and analyze the responses in a visual format, gaining insights from the data collected.  

The latest online deployment of the application can be found at https://yamp.azurewebsites.net/.

## Project Structure:
The github repository is composed of 2 directories:
1) **/backend**
   - A Spring Boot application serving as the bridge between the frontend and the database, handling API requests and business logic.
2) **/frontend**
   - A React application that enables users to create, share, and analyze surveys through an interactive interface.

## How to Run Project Locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed and properly configured (Exp: Path environment variables):
- [Java JDK 21+](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 
- [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)

### Steps

**1. Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yehandesilva/MonkeyPoll.git
   cd MonkeyPoll
   ```

**2. Build the frontend (Must be done before running the backend):**  
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   
**3. Build and run the backend:**
   ```
   cd ../backend
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The application should now be running at http://localhost:8080.
